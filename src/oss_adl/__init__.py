"""
OSS ADL reproduction package.

This package is intentionally small and heavily commented. The goal is not to be a
general ADL simulator; it is to reproduce a small set of defensible, debate-relevant
numbers from:
  - HyperReplay (raw + canonical event data)
  - HyperMultiAssetedADL (canonical ADL tables / liquidations exports)

See `OSS/methodology.md` for the full, adversary-oriented methodology writeup.
